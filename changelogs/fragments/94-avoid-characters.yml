minor_changes:
  - "New extra check ``avoid-characters`` allows to flag characters / regular expressions. This can for example be used to avoid tabulator characters,
     but also more complex character sequences
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/issues/89, https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/94)."
