minor_changes:
  - |-
    Antsibull-nox now supports VCS configuration and basic change detection.
    At the moment, the following tests support change detection:
    
    * All ansible-test tests configured through ``antsibull-nox.toml``;
    * All ansible-test tests configured through ``noxfile.py`` that explicitly allow change detection;
    * All ``lint`` sessions (``formatters``, ``codeqa``, ``yamllint``, ``typing``);
    * The ``extra-checks`` session and all its tests;
    * All tests but ``reuse`` from the ``license-check`` session;
    * The `docs-check` sessions are restricted to changed files (for code-block tests),
      or skipped if there are no appropriate changed files.

    Change detection can be enabled with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_CHANGE_DETECTION``.
    The base branch can explicitly set with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_BASE_BRANCH``
