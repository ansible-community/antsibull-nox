minor_changes:
  - "For running pylint and mypy, copy the collection and dependent collections into a new tree.
     This allows the collection repository to be checked out outside an approriate tree structure,
     and it also allows the dependent collections to live in another tree structure,
     as long as ``ansible-galaxy collection list`` can find them
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/1)."
