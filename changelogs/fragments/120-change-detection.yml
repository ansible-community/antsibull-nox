  - |-
    Antsibull-nox now supports VCS configuration and basic change detection.
    At the moment, the following tests support change detection:
    
    * All ansible-test tests configured through ``antsibull-nox.toml``;
    * All ansible-test tests configured through ``noxfile.py`` that explicitly allow change detection.

    Change detection can be enabled with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_CHANGE_DETECTION``.
    The base branch can explicitly set with the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_BASE_BRANCH``
