minor_changes:
  - "Always show tracebacks in case of errors for ansible-core 2.19+ in integration tests.
     Showing these has been turned off by default in ansible-core 2.19, which is great for
     intentional errors, but makes debugging unintentional ones (like plugin crashes)
     hard to debug since you do not see where the error comes from
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/190)."
