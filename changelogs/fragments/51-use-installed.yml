minor_changes:
  - "In the GitHub Action, no longer use installed collections, but only ones that have been checked out next to the current one.
     This avoids using collections that come with the Ansible community package installed in the default GHA image
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/51)."
  - "Allow to disable using installed collections that are not checked out next to the current one
     by setting the environment variable ``ANTSIBULL_NOX_IGNORE_INSTALLED_COLLECTIONS`` to ``true``
     (https://github.com/ansible-community/antsibull-nox/pull/51)."
